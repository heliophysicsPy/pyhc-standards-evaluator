## Executive Summary

astrometry_azel demonstrates strong compliance with PyHC standards overall. The package excels in software maturity with proper packaging, releases, and cross-platform CI/CD, and provides good documentation with practical examples. However, it requires improvement in community standards due to missing code of conduct and contribution guidelines, and testing coverage appears limited despite having automated testing infrastructure. To achieve full PyHC compliance, the primary focus should be on adding community governance documents and expanding test coverage.

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Community ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

The project demonstrates open development and provides unique functionality, but lacks formal community governance structures required for full compliance.

- **Open Development**\*: ✅ Code is publicly available and developed on GitHub at https://github.com/space-physics/astrometry_geomap
- **Duplication**: ✅ Provides unique functionality for converting astrometry.net results to azimuth/elevation coordinates, not duplicating existing packages
- **Collaboration**\*: ⚠️ Has basic issue tracking on GitHub but no formal CONTRIBUTING.md or issue templates to guide contributors
- **Code of Conduct**\*: ❌ No code of conduct file found in repository

### 2. Documentation ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Documentation is comprehensive with clear usage examples and installation instructions, meeting most PyHC requirements despite minor formatting inconsistencies.

- **Docstrings**\*: ✅ All major functions in src/astrometry_azel/__init__.py have docstrings
- **Docstring Content**\*: ✅ Docstrings describe purpose, parameters, returns, and include type hints
- **Docstring Standards**\*: ⚠️ Docstrings are present but don't consistently follow numpydoc format
- **High-Level Documentation**\*: ✅ Comprehensive README.md with installation, usage examples, and technical details
- **Documentation Accessibility**\*: ✅ Documentation is in version control and publicly accessible on GitHub

### 3. Testing ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

Testing infrastructure exists with automated CI/CD but appears to have limited coverage across the codebase.

- **Unit Tests**\*: ⚠️ Unit tests exist in src/astrometry_azel/tests/test_all.py but only test core functions, not all modules
- **Integration Tests**\*: ⚠️ Tests cover integration with astrometry.net solve-field but limited component interaction testing
- **Test Coverage**: ❌ No coverage measurement implemented or reported
- **Automated Testing**: ✅ GitHub Actions CI runs tests automatically on Python 3.9 and 3.12 across multiple OS
- **System/Acceptance Testing**: ⚠️ Tests include real data validation but no comprehensive system-level testing

### 4. Software Maturity ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Excellent software engineering practices with proper packaging, versioning, and development infrastructure.

- **Packaging**\*: ✅ Well-organized package structure using modern pyproject.toml configuration
- **Releases**: ✅ Available on PyPI as "astrometry-azel" with proper semantic versioning (v1.4.0)
- **Semantic Versioning**: ✅ Follows semantic versioning with version 1.4.0 indicating stable release
- **OS Support**: ✅ CI tests on Ubuntu and includes macOS setup, supports cross-platform usage
- **Version Control**\*: ✅ Uses Git with distributed development on GitHub
- **Coding Style**\*: ✅ Includes Black formatter configuration and uses type hints throughout
- **Static Analysis**: ✅ CI includes flake8 and mypy linting with comprehensive rule set
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Minimal, well-justified dependencies (astropy, numpy, xarray, etc.)
- **Binaries**: ✅ No unnecessary binaries in repository, only test data files

### 5. Python 3 ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Fully committed to Python 3 with modern language features and no legacy Python 2 support.

- **Python 3 Compatibility**\*: ✅ Requires Python >=3.9, uses modern Python features like type hints and f-strings

### 6. License ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Properly licensed with a permissive, OSI-approved license suitable for scientific software.

- **License Exists**\*: ✅ LICENSE.txt file present in repository root
- **License Type**: ✅ Uses ISC license, which is permissive and recommended for scientific software
- **OSI Approved**: ✅ ISC is an OSI-approved permissive license

*(\* = "must")*

## Recommendations

### 🔴 "Musts"
*These must be addressed to meet minimum PyHC standards*

1. **Add Code of Conduct**: Create a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file based on the Contributor Covenant
   - Use the standard Contributor Covenant template
   - Specify contact information for enforcement

2. **Improve Collaboration Infrastructure**: Create CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines
   - Explain how to contribute code, report issues, and suggest features
   - Include development setup instructions and testing procedures

### 🟡 "Shoulds"
*Important for package quality but not blocking compliance*

1. **Implement Test Coverage Measurement**: Add coverage reporting to CI pipeline and aim for >80% coverage
2. **Expand Test Suite**: Add unit tests for scripts/ modules and PlateScale.py/PlotGeomap.py functionality
3. **Standardize Docstring Format**: Convert docstrings to consistent numpydoc format

### 🟢 Suggested Improvements
*Enhancements that would strengthen the package*

1. **Add Issue Templates**: Create GitHub issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
2. **Documentation Website**: Consider creating a dedicated documentation site using Sphinx
3. **Add CHANGELOG**: Maintain a changelog to track version changes and improvements

## Conclusion

astrometry_azel is a well-engineered package that provides valuable functionality for the heliophysics community. It demonstrates strong software engineering practices with proper packaging, automated testing, and comprehensive documentation. The package is very close to full PyHC compliance, requiring only the addition of community governance documents (code of conduct and contribution guidelines) to meet all mandatory requirements. The scientific utility and quality implementation make it a good candidate for the PyHC project list once these community standards are addressed.
