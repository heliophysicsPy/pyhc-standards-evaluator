## Recommendations

### üü° "Shoulds"
*Important for package quality but not blocking compliance*

1. **Add Contribution Guidelines**: Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file with clear guidelines for contributors, including development setup, testing procedures, and code review process

### üü¢ Suggested Improvements
*Enhancements that would strengthen the package*

1. **Issue Templates**: Add GitHub issue templates to help users report bugs and request features more effectively
2. **Pull Request Template**: Create a PR template to standardize the contribution process
3. **Development Documentation**: Add developer-specific documentation for setting up the development environment

## Conclusion

**solarmach** is a well-engineered scientific package that nearly achieves full PyHC compliance. The package excels in all critical areas including documentation, testing, software maturity, Python 3 compatibility, and licensing. The only gap preventing full compliance is the absence of formal contribution guidelines, which is easily addressable. The package provides valuable functionality to the heliophysics community with professional development practices, comprehensive testing, and excellent documentation. With the addition of contribution guidelines, this package would fully meet all PyHC standards and serve as an exemplary member of the Python in Heliophysics ecosystem.
