## Executive Summary

**EUVpy** demonstrates moderate compliance with PyHC standards, excelling in documentation and testing. The package provides valuable scientific functionality for solar EUV irradiance modeling with four different empirical models (NEUVAC, EUVAC, HEUVAC, SOLOMON). However, gaps exist in community standards and installation complexity due to Fortran dependencies that affect user accessibility. To achieve PyHC compliance, the package requires contribution guidelines and a community code of conduct.

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Community ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

While the package demonstrates open development practices, it would benefit from formal community guidelines to facilitate broader collaboration.

- **Open Development**\*: ‚úÖ Code is publicly available and developed on GitHub at https://github.com/DanBrandt/EUVpy
- **Duplication**: ‚úÖ Provides unique solar EUV irradiance modeling functionality not found elsewhere in the ecosystem
- **Collaboration**\*: ‚ùå No CONTRIBUTING.md file, issue templates, or formal contribution guidelines found in repository
- **Code of Conduct**\*: ‚ùå README contains citation guidelines labeled "Code of Conduct" but no Contributor Covenant-compatible community code of conduct

### 2. Documentation ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Documentation is comprehensive and well-structured, covering all required aspects with proper docstring standards and accessible online resources.

- **Docstrings**\*: ‚úÖ All functions, classes, and modules have detailed documentation strings
- **Docstring Content**\*: ‚úÖ Docstrings describe purpose, inputs, outputs, and include examples following numpydoc conventions
- **Docstring Standards**\*: ‚úÖ Consistent use of numpydoc format throughout the codebase
- **High-Level Documentation**\*: ‚úÖ Comprehensive README, Jupyter notebook examples, and Sphinx documentation in docs/ directory
- **Documentation Accessibility**\*: ‚úÖ Documentation is in version control and available online via repository

### 3. Testing ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Testing infrastructure meets all required standards with comprehensive unit and integration tests covering all major components.

- **Unit Tests**\*: ‚úÖ Comprehensive unit tests for all models (NEUVAC, EUVAC, HEUVAC, SOLOMON) in tests/ directory
- **Integration Tests**\*: ‚úÖ Tests verify integration between models and data processing tools
- **Test Coverage**: ‚ö†Ô∏è No formal coverage measurement tools, but comprehensive test suite provides good coverage
- **Automated Testing**: ‚ö†Ô∏è No CI/CD pipeline configured, but tests can be run locally with pytest
- **System/Acceptance Testing**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual validation notebooks exist for higher-level testing

### 4. Software Maturity ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

The package demonstrates good development practices and stable releases, but installation complexity due to Fortran dependencies may hinder user adoption.

- **Packaging**\*: ‚úÖ Properly organized as installable Python package with setup.py and src/ layout
- **Releases**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Available on PyPI but installation requires additional Fortran compilation steps. Version 1.0.0 indicates stable release. Not available on Conda.
- **Semantic Versioning**: ‚úÖ Uses semantic versioning (1.0.0 for stable release)
- **OS Support**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Cross-platform support available but requires manual gfortran installation and Fortran compilation, adding complexity for users
- **Version Control**\*: ‚úÖ Uses Git with proper repository structure and history
- **Coding Style**\*: ‚úÖ Code follows PEP 8 conventions with consistent formatting
- **Static Analysis**: ‚ö†Ô∏è No evidence of automated linting tools like flake8 or pylint
- **Dependencies**: ‚úÖ Dependencies are well-justified scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc.)
- **Binaries**: ‚úÖ Minimal binary content, only necessary Fortran source files for HEUVAC model

### 5. Python 3 ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Full Python 3 compatibility with no legacy Python 2 dependencies or compatibility code.

- **Python 3 Compatibility**\*: ‚úÖ Requires Python 3.7+ as specified in setup.py, no Python 2 support

### 6. License ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Proper licensing with permissive terms suitable for open source scientific software.

- **License Exists**\*: ‚úÖ MIT License file present in repository root
- **License Type**: ‚úÖ MIT is a permissive license recommended for open source scientific software
- **OSI Approved**: ‚úÖ MIT License is OSI-approved

*(\* = "must")*

## Recommendations

### üî¥ "Musts"
*These must be addressed to meet minimum PyHC standards*

1. **Add Code of Conduct**: Create a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file compatible with the Contributor Covenant and make it publicly accessible in the repository root
2. **Create Contribution Guidelines**: Add CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for contributing code, reporting issues, and requesting features

### üü° "Shoulds"
*Important for package quality but not blocking compliance*

1. **Simplify Installation Process**: Consider pre-compiling Fortran components or providing binary distributions to reduce installation complexity
2. **Publish to Conda**: Upload package to conda-forge for broader distribution alongside PyPI availability


### üü¢ Suggested Improvements
*Enhancements that would strengthen the package*

1. **Add Issue and PR Templates**: Create GitHub templates to standardize bug reports and feature requests
2. **Implement Automated Testing**: Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD pipeline to run tests automatically on commits and pull requests
3. **Add Test Coverage Measurement**: Implement coverage reporting tools (pytest-cov, codecov) to measure and track test coverage
4. **Add Static Analysis Tools**: Implement automated code quality checks using tools like flake8, pylint, or black

## Conclusion

EUVpy is a well-developed scientific package that provides valuable functionality for solar EUV irradiance modeling. The package demonstrates solid technical foundations with comprehensive documentation and testing. The primary gaps preventing full PyHC compliance are the absence of community guidelines, a code of conduct, and installation complexity due to Fortran dependencies. While the community infrastructure gaps are straightforward to address, simplifying the installation process would significantly improve user accessibility. Overall, EUVpy represents a valuable contribution to the heliophysics Python ecosystem that would benefit from addressing these usability and community aspects.
