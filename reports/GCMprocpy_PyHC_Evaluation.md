## Executive Summary

GCMprocpy demonstrates moderate compliance with PyHC standards. The package excels in Python 3 compatibility and licensing but requires significant improvement in community standards and testing infrastructure. This specialized tool for TIE-GCM and WACCM-X atmospheric model post-processing provides valuable scientific functionality. To achieve full PyHC compliance, the primary focus should be on establishing a comprehensive test suite and implementing proper community guidelines.

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Community ![Requires improvement](https://img.shields.io/badge/Requires%20improvement-red.svg)

The project lacks essential community infrastructure, with no code of conduct or contribution guidelines, preventing effective collaboration and failing to meet minimum community standards.

- **Open Development**\*: ✅ Code is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/NCAR/gcmprocpy
- **Duplication**: ✅ Provides unique TIE-GCM and WACCM-X post-processing functionality not found elsewhere in the ecosystem
- **Collaboration**\*: ❌ No CONTRIBUTING.md file, no issue templates, and no clear contribution process documented
- **Code of Conduct**\*: ❌ No code of conduct file found in repository

### 2. Documentation ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

Documentation exists with online presence at ReadTheDocs but docstring coverage is inconsistent across the codebase, with some functions well-documented while others lack proper documentation.

- **Docstrings**\*: ⚠️ Some functions have docstrings (e.g., `is_notebook`, `mov_lat_lon`) but many modules lack comprehensive documentation
- **Docstring Content**\*: ⚠️ Where present, docstrings describe purpose and arguments but examples are limited
- **Docstring Standards**\*: ⚠️ Inconsistent format, not following standard conventions like numpydoc consistently
- **High-Level Documentation**\*: ✅ Comprehensive documentation available at https://gcmprocpy.readthedocs.io with installation, usage, and API guides
- **Documentation Accessibility**\*: ✅ Documentation is in version control (docs/ folder) and available online

### 3. Testing ![Requires improvement](https://img.shields.io/badge/Requires%20improvement-red.svg)

Testing infrastructure is critically absent with no unit tests, integration tests, or automated testing framework found in the repository, requiring immediate attention for PyHC compliance.

- **Unit Tests**\*: ❌ No test files or test directory found in the repository
- **Integration Tests**\*: ❌ No integration testing framework present
- **Test Coverage**: ❌ No coverage measurement implemented or configured
- **Automated Testing**: ❌ No CI/CD pipeline or automated testing setup
- **System/Acceptance Testing**: ❌ No higher-level testing framework implemented

### 4. Software Maturity ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

The package demonstrates good packaging practices with proper setup.py and PyPI distribution, meeting core software maturity requirements despite some areas for improvement.

- **Packaging**\*: ✅ Well-structured package with proper setup.py in gcmprocpy/src/gcmprocpy/ structure
- **Releases**: ✅ Available on PyPI (version 1.0.0); not on conda-forge but PyPI distribution meets the requirement
- **Semantic Versioning**: ⚠️ Uses version numbers (1.0.0 on PyPI, 1.2.0 locally) but unclear adherence to semantic versioning principles
- **OS Support**: ⚠️ Python package should work cross-platform but dependencies like cartopy may have OS-specific requirements
- **Version Control**\*: ✅ Uses git for version control on GitHub
- **Coding Style**\*: ⚠️ Generally follows Python conventions but no formal PEP 8 enforcement visible
- **Static Analysis**: ❌ No evidence of linting tools (pylint, flake8) configuration
- **Dependencies**: ⚠️ Reasonable dependencies for scientific computing but includes GUI dependencies (PyQt5) that may not be minimal
- **Binaries**: ✅ Repository contains only source code, no unnecessary binaries

### 5. Python 3 ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

The package is fully compatible with Python 3, requiring Python 3.8+ and has completely dropped Python 2 support.

- **Python 3 Compatibility**\*: ✅ Requires Python >= 3.8.0 as specified in setup.py, no Python 2 compatibility code found

### 6. License ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

The project uses the Apache License 2.0, which is a permissive, OSI-approved license appropriate for open source scientific software.

- **License Exists**\*: ✅ LICENSE file present with Apache License 2.0
- **License Type**: ✅ Apache 2.0 is a permissive license (not copyleft like GPL)
- **OSI Approved**: ✅ Apache License 2.0 is OSI-approved

## Recommendations

### 🔴 "Musts"
*These must be addressed to meet minimum PyHC standards*

1. **Implement Comprehensive Test Suite**: Create unit tests for all modules in gcmprocpy/src/gcmprocpy/, focusing on core functions like plot generation, data parsing, and I/O operations
   - Add tests/ directory with test files for each module
   - Aim for significant code coverage of critical functionality

2. **Add Code of Conduct**: Create a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file compatible with the Contributor Covenant
   - Can use the standard Contributor Covenant template
   - Make it publicly accessible in the repository root

3. **Create Contribution Guidelines**: Add CONTRIBUTING.md with clear guidelines for contributing code, reporting issues, and development setup
   - Include development environment setup instructions
   - Define code review process and coding standards

### 🟡 "Shoulds"
*Important for package quality but not blocking compliance*

1. **Improve Docstring Coverage**: Ensure all functions, classes, and modules have proper docstrings following numpydoc format
   - Focus on modules with missing docstrings in cmd/ and main processing modules

2. **Add Conda Distribution**: Submit package to conda-forge for broader accessibility (recommended but not required)
   - Create conda-forge feedstock recipe
   - Enables easier installation for conda users

3. **Implement Automated Testing**: Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) to run tests automatically
   - Add coverage reporting and badges
   - Ensure tests run on multiple Python versions and OS platforms

4. **Establish Formal Release Process**: Create tagged releases on GitHub with release notes
   - Implement semantic versioning clearly
   - Coordinate PyPI and GitHub releases

### 🟢 Suggested Improvements
*Enhancements that would strengthen the package*

1. **Add Static Analysis Tools**: Configure pylint or flake8 for consistent code style
   - Add pre-commit hooks for automated code formatting

2. **Improve Documentation**: Add more usage examples and tutorials
   - Include Jupyter notebook examples in documentation
   - Add API reference with better cross-linking

3. **Optimize Dependencies**: Review if all dependencies are necessary, particularly GUI components
   - Consider making PyQt5 an optional dependency for CLI-only usage

## Conclusion

GCMprocpy serves as a specialized and valuable tool for atmospheric modeling post-processing, providing unique functionality for the TIE-GCM and WACCM-X scientific communities. While the package demonstrates solid software engineering practices in packaging and Python 3 compatibility, it requires significant improvements in testing and community infrastructure to meet PyHC standards. The absence of a test suite is the most critical gap, followed by missing community guidelines. With focused effort on these areas, GCMprocpy has strong potential to become a fully compliant PyHC package that serves the heliophysics community effectively.
