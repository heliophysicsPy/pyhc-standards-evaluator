## Executive Summary

SAMMI demonstrates excellent compliance with PyHC standards, excelling in documentation, testing, software maturity, and licensing practices. The project has proper automated testing, comprehensive documentation hosted on ReadTheDocs, and follows modern Python packaging standards with an appropriate permissive license. The only area preventing full compliance is the absence of a project-specific code of conduct file. To achieve complete PyHC compliance, the primary focus should be on establishing a formal code of conduct in the repository.

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Community ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

The project demonstrates good open development practices and encourages collaboration, but lacks a project-specific code of conduct despite referencing an external one.

- **Open Development**\*: ✅ Code is publicly available and developed on GitHub at https://github.com/swxsoc/sammi
- **Duplication**: ✅ Provides unique CDF attribute management functionality for space weather data, not duplicating existing packages
- **Collaboration**\*: ✅ README.rst:66-96 contains extensive contribution guidelines with "imposter syndrome disclaimer" encouraging contributions
- **Code of Conduct**\*: ⚠️ References external SWxSOC code of conduct but no project-specific CODE_OF_CONDUCT file in repository

### 2. Documentation ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Documentation is comprehensive and well-structured, meeting all PyHC requirements with online accessibility and proper docstring conventions.

- **Docstrings**\*: ✅ All functions and classes have docstrings in sammi/cdf_attribute_manager.py and sammi/validation.py
- **Docstring Content**\*: ✅ Docstrings describe purpose, inputs, outputs, and include examples where appropriate
- **Docstring Standards**\*: ✅ Follows standard Python docstring conventions consistent with scientific Python packages
- **High-Level Documentation**\*: ✅ Comprehensive docs/ directory with user guides, developer guides, API documentation, and installation instructions
- **Documentation Accessibility**\*: ✅ Documentation in version control and available online at https://sammi-cdf.readthedocs.io

### 3. Testing ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Testing infrastructure is robust with unit tests, automated CI/CD, and coverage tracking meeting all PyHC requirements.

- **Unit Tests**\*: ✅ Unit tests present in sammi/tests/ covering individual components like CdfAttributeManager
- **Integration Tests**\*: ✅ Integration tests in test_validation.py testing component interactions
- **Test Coverage**: ✅ Coverage configuration in pyproject.toml:85-101 and CodeCov integration shown in README badges
- **Automated Testing**: ✅ GitHub Actions workflows for testing, code style, and coverage visible in README badges
- **System/Acceptance Testing**: ✅ Test data and validation tests present in sammi/tests/test_data/

### 4. Software Maturity ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Software maturity standards are excellently implemented with modern packaging, proper releases, and comprehensive development practices.

- **Packaging**\*: ✅ Proper Python package structure with pyproject.toml build configuration
- **Releases**: ✅ Available on PyPI as "sammi-cdf" per README.rst:49-53, follows semantic versioning with setuptools_scm
- **Semantic Versioning**: ✅ Uses setuptools_scm for automatic versioning in pyproject.toml:72-73
- **OS Support**: ✅ Classifiers in pyproject.toml indicate "Operating System :: OS Independent"
- **Version Control**\*: ✅ Uses Git with GitHub hosting and proper repository structure
- **Coding Style**\*: ✅ Black and flake8 configured in pyproject.toml:60-64 for PEP 8 compliance
- **Static Analysis**: ✅ flake8, black, and rstcheck tools configured for code quality
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Minimal dependencies with only pyyaml>=5.3.1 as core requirement
- **Binaries**: ✅ No unnecessary binary files in repository, only essential data files in sammi/data/

### 5. Python 3 ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Full Python 3 compatibility with modern version requirements and no legacy Python 2 support.

- **Python 3 Compatibility**\*: ✅ Requires Python >=3.9 per pyproject.toml:14, no Python 2 support maintained

### 6. License ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

The project has an appropriate permissive license that meets all PyHC requirements.

- **License Exists**\*: ✅ LICENSE.rst and licenses/LICENSE.md files present in repository
- **License Type**: ✅ Apache License 2.0 is a permissive, OSI-approved license suitable for scientific software
- **OSI Approved**: ✅ Apache 2.0 is an OSI-approved open source license

*(\* = "must")*

## Recommendations

### 🔴 "Musts"
*These must be addressed to meet minimum PyHC standards*

1. **Add Project Code of Conduct**: Create a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file in the repository root that is compatible with Contributor Covenant, rather than only referencing external SWxSOC code of conduct

### 🟡 "Shoulds"
*Important for package quality but not blocking compliance*

1. **Consider BSD License**: While Apache 2.0 is acceptable, PyHC specifically mentions BSD licenses as examples of preferred permissive licenses for scientific software

### 🟢 Suggested Improvements
*Enhancements that would strengthen the package*

1. **Enhance Test Coverage Reporting**: Consider adding coverage percentage targets and more detailed coverage reporting in CI
2. **Add Contributing Guidelines File**: While contribution guidelines exist in README, consider creating a separate CONTRIBUTING.md file for better discoverability
3. **Conda Distribution**: Consider adding conda-forge distribution alongside PyPI for broader accessibility in scientific Python ecosystem

## Conclusion

SAMMI is a well-developed scientific Python package that demonstrates excellent adherence to PyHC standards. The project excels in documentation, testing, software engineering practices, and licensing, with comprehensive automated testing, professional documentation, modern packaging, and an appropriate permissive license. The only area requiring attention is adding a project-specific code of conduct file. Overall, SAMMI represents a mature approach to scientific software development and would be a valuable addition to the PyHC ecosystem with this single minor adjustment.
