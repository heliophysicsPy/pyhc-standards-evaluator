## Executive Summary

IRI90 demonstrates moderate compliance with PyHC standards. The package excels in Python 3 compatibility and licensing but requires significant improvement in testing infrastructure and documentation completeness. The package provides valuable scientific functionality for ionospheric modeling with a clean Python interface to the IRI90 Fortran code. To achieve full PyHC compliance, the primary focus should be on establishing comprehensive testing coverage and improving documentation standards.

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Community ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

While the project demonstrates open development and provides unique functionality, the lack of contribution guidelines and code of conduct prevents a "Good" rating.

- **Open Development**\*: ✅ Code is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/space-physics/iri90 with active development
- **Duplication**: ✅ Provides unique Python interface to IRI90 ionospheric model, not duplicating existing Python packages
- **Collaboration**\*: ⚠️ Basic README exists but no CONTRIBUTING.md, issue templates, or clear contribution guidelines
- **Code of Conduct**\*: ❌ No code of conduct file found in repository

### 2. Documentation ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

Basic documentation exists with README and example usage, but lacks comprehensive docstring coverage and detailed guides.

- **Docstrings**\*: ⚠️ Main functions in __init__.py have basic docstrings but many functions lack comprehensive documentation
- **Docstring Content**\*: ⚠️ Existing docstrings describe purpose and inputs but lack detailed output descriptions and examples
- **Docstring Standards**\*: ⚠️ Some docstrings follow standard format but inconsistent throughout codebase
- **High-Level Documentation**\*: ⚠️ README provides installation and basic usage but lacks comprehensive tutorials or developer documentation
- **Documentation Accessibility**\*: ✅ Documentation is in version control and accessible via GitHub

### 3. Testing ![Requires improvement](https://img.shields.io/badge/Requires%20improvement-red.svg)

Testing infrastructure is critically lacking with only a single test file containing minimal tests, requiring immediate attention for PyHC compliance.

- **Unit Tests**\*: ❌ Only one test file (test_all.py) with a single test function, insufficient coverage
- **Integration Tests**\*: ❌ No comprehensive integration testing framework beyond the single altitude test
- **Test Coverage**: ❌ No coverage measurement implemented, estimated very low coverage
- **Automated Testing**: ⚠️ Basic CI/CD pipeline exists (.github/workflows/ci.yml) but only runs on Linux
- **System/Acceptance Testing**: ❌ No system or acceptance testing framework implemented

### 4. Software Maturity ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

The package demonstrates good packaging practices with proper releases but lacks some maturity indicators like multi-OS CI and comprehensive coding standards.

- **Packaging**\*: ✅ Properly organized as installable Python package with setup.py and pyproject.toml
- **Releases**: ✅ Available on PyPI with version 1.1.1, proper semantic versioning
- **Semantic Versioning**: ✅ Follows semantic versioning (1.1.1)
- **OS Support**: ⚠️ Code supports multiple OS but CI only runs on Linux (macOS and Windows commented out)
- **Version Control**\*: ✅ Uses git with proper version control practices
- **Coding Style**\*: ⚠️ Uses black formatter (configured in pyproject.toml) but not consistently applied
- **Static Analysis**: ⚠️ CI includes flake8 and mypy but may not be comprehensively configured
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Minimal dependencies (numpy, xarray) are well-justified for scientific computing
- **Binaries**: ✅ Repository appropriately includes necessary data files, no unnecessary binaries

### 5. Python 3 ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Full Python 3 compatibility with appropriate version requirements and no Python 2 legacy code.

- **Python 3 Compatibility**\*: ✅ Package requires Python >= 3.7 as specified in setup.cfg, fully Python 3 compatible

### 6. License ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

MIT license is properly implemented with appropriate permissions for open source scientific software.

- **License Exists**\*: ✅ LICENSE.txt file present in repository
- **License Type**: ✅ MIT license is permissive and appropriate for scientific software
- **OSI Approved**: ✅ MIT license is OSI-approved

*(\* = "must")*

## Recommendations

### 🔴 "Musts"
*These must be addressed to meet minimum PyHC standards*

1. **Add Code of Conduct**: Create a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file compatible with Contributor Covenant
2. **Establish Contribution Guidelines**: Create CONTRIBUTING.md with clear guidelines for contributions
3. **Expand Unit Testing**: Develop comprehensive unit tests covering all major functions and modules
4. **Improve Integration Testing**: Create integration tests that test component interactions
5. **Enhance Docstrings**: Ensure all functions, classes, and modules have complete docstrings with purpose, inputs, outputs, and examples

### 🟡 "Shoulds"
*Important for package quality but not blocking compliance*

1. **Implement Test Coverage Measurement**: Add coverage reporting to CI pipeline
2. **Enable Multi-OS CI**: Uncomment and fix macOS and Windows CI workflows
3. **Create Comprehensive Documentation**: Develop user guides, tutorials, and developer documentation
4. **Improve Static Analysis**: Ensure flake8 and mypy are properly configured and passing

### 🟢 Suggested Improvements
*Enhancements that would strengthen the package*

1. **Add System Testing**: Implement end-to-end testing with scientific validation
2. **Create Issue Templates**: Add GitHub issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
3. **Improve Example Documentation**: Expand example scripts with more detailed explanations
4. **Consider Documentation Website**: Create a dedicated documentation site (e.g., using Sphinx)

## Conclusion

IRI90 provides valuable scientific functionality with a clean Python interface to the established IRI90 ionospheric model. While the package demonstrates good software engineering practices in packaging and Python 3 compatibility, significant improvements are needed in testing infrastructure, documentation completeness, and community engagement features to achieve full PyHC compliance. The package's scientific value and clean architecture provide a solid foundation for addressing these compliance gaps.
