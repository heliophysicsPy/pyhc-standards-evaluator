- **Automated Testing**: ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline runs tests on push/PR across Python 3.8-3.10 and multiple OS
- **System/Acceptance Testing**: ✅ Test data and reference files provide system-level validation

### 4. Software Maturity ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

While the package demonstrates mature software engineering practices, the lack of PyPI and Conda distribution prevents a "Good" rating.

- **Packaging**\*: ✅ Well-organized installable Python package with proper setup.py and setup.cfg configuration
- **Releases**: ⚠️ Stable releases available with version 0.3.0 but not distributed via PyPI or Conda
- **Semantic Versioning**: ✅ Follows semantic versioning principles with proper version file management
- **OS Support**: ✅ Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows as demonstrated in CI configuration
- **Version Control**\*: ✅ Uses Git with proper branching strategy and distributed development
- **Coding Style**\*: ✅ Follows PEP 8 standards with flake8 linting enforced in CI
- **Static Analysis**: ✅ Flake8 and complexity analysis integrated into CI pipeline
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Minimal, well-justified dependencies (numpy, pandas, scipy, xarray, netCDF4)
- **Binaries**: ✅ Avoids unnecessary binaries in repository, though includes essential Fortran source files

### 5. Python 3 ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Full Python 3 compatibility with modern version support and no legacy Python 2 dependencies.

- **Python 3 Compatibility**\*: ✅ Requires Python >= 3.5, actively tests on Python 3.8-3.10, no Python 2 support

### 6. License ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Proper open-source licensing with permissive BSD 3-clause license implementation.

- **License Exists**\*: ✅ License.md file present in repository root
- **License Type**: ✅ BSD 3-clause license is permissive and appropriate for open-source scientific software
- **OSI Approved**: ✅ BSD 3-clause is OSI-approved and meets PyHC requirements

*(\* = "must")*

## Recommendations

### 🟡 "Shoulds"
*Important for package quality but not blocking compliance*

1. **PyPI Distribution**: Distribute stable releases through PyPI to improve installation convenience and meet standard packaging expectations.
2. **Conda Distribution**: Explore conda-forge distribution to provide alternative installation method for users.

### 🟢 Suggested Improvements
*Enhancements that would strengthen the package*

1. **Enhanced Community Engagement**: Consider more active outreach to the heliophysics community through workshops, presentations, or community calls to increase adoption and contributions.
2. **Documentation Enhancement**: Add more tutorial examples and use cases to demonstrate the package's capabilities.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Consider profiling and optimizing the Fortran compilation process for better user experience.

## Conclusion

Sami2py demonstrates excellent compliance with PyHC standards, meeting all critical requirements and many recommended practices. The package provides valuable scientific functionality with proper documentation, testing, and software engineering practices. The strong foundation in community infrastructure, comprehensive documentation, and robust testing makes it a valuable contribution to the PyHC ecosystem. With minor enhancements in community engagement and distribution, sami2py represents a high-quality scientific Python package that serves the heliophysics community well.
