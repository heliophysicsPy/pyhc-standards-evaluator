## Recommendations

### 🟡 "Shoulds"
*Important for package quality but not blocking compliance*

1. **Expand Test Coverage**: Increase unit test coverage from ~19% to >80% of source files
   - Add tests for untested modules in fermi/, iris/, lyra/, rhessi/, and suvi/ packages
   - Implement more comprehensive integration tests

2. **Automate Acceptance Testing**: Convert example scripts to automated tests
   - Transform examples/ scripts into pytest-based acceptance tests
   - Integrate with CI pipeline for regular validation

### 🟢 Suggested Improvements
*Enhancements that would strengthen the package*

1. **Add Contribution Guidelines**: Create CONTRIBUTING.md with specific development instructions
   - Document development setup process
   - Provide clear guidelines for new instrument tool contributions

2. **Enhance CI/CD**: Consider adding GitHub Actions for additional automation
   - Automated testing on multiple operating systems
   - Automated documentation deployment

## Conclusion

sunkit-instruments demonstrates excellent compliance with PyHC standards, meeting all critical requirements across community practices, documentation, software maturity, Python 3 compatibility, and licensing. The package serves as a model for SunPy-affiliated projects with its clear purpose, strong community integration, and professional development practices. While testing coverage could be enhanced, the existing infrastructure provides a solid foundation for continued development and community contribution.
