## Executive Summary

sunraster demonstrates strong compliance with PyHC standards overall. The package excels in software maturity with excellent CI/CD practices, comprehensive packaging setup, and proper licensing. The documentation is well-structured with proper docstrings and online availability. However, the package requires improvement in community governance (missing code of conduct) and testing coverage could be more comprehensive. To achieve full PyHC compliance, the primary focus should be on adding a code of conduct and expanding test coverage.

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Community ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

The project demonstrates excellent open development practices and welcoming collaboration culture but lacks formal community governance structures.

- **Open Development***: ✅ Code is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/sunpy/sunraster with active development
- **Duplication**: ✅ Provides unique functionality for solar spectrogram data analysis, complementing but not duplicating SunPy ecosystem
- **Collaboration***: ⚠️ Comprehensive contribution section in README with "imposter syndrome disclaimer" but no dedicated CONTRIBUTING.md file
- **Code of Conduct***: ❌ No code of conduct file found in repository

### 2. Documentation ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Documentation meets all PyHC requirements with comprehensive coverage and proper formatting standards.

- **Docstrings***: ✅ All functions and classes have proper docstrings following numpy/scipy conventions
- **Docstring Content***: ✅ Docstrings describe purpose, inputs, outputs, and include examples where appropriate
- **Docstring Standards***: ✅ Follows numpydoc standard convention with proper formatting
- **High-Level Documentation***: ✅ Comprehensive documentation at https://docs.sunpy.org/projects/sunraster with guides and API reference
- **Documentation Accessibility***: ✅ Documentation in version control under /docs/ directory and published online

### 3. Testing ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

Strong CI/CD infrastructure and automated testing setup but limited test coverage across the codebase.

- **Unit Tests***: ⚠️ Only 3 test files for 16 Python source files, indicating limited test coverage
- **Integration Tests***: ✅ CI tests cover integration across multiple Python versions and dependencies
- **Test Coverage**: ⚠️ Coverage reporting configured with codecov but actual coverage appears limited
- **Automated Testing**: ✅ Comprehensive GitHub Actions CI with multi-platform testing and automated PyPI publishing
- **System/Acceptance Testing**: ✅ CI includes tests with real data files and multiple dependency versions

### 4. Software Maturity ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Excellent implementation of all software maturity standards with modern development practices.

- **Packaging***: ✅ Properly organized as installable Python package with modern pyproject.toml configuration
- **Releases**: ✅ Available on PyPI (v0.6.0) and conda-forge (v0.5.1) with semantic versioning
- **Semantic Versioning**: ✅ Uses semantic versioning with pre-1.0 development versions (0.6.0)
- **OS Support**: ✅ CI tests on Linux, Windows, and macOS platforms
- **Version Control***: ✅ Uses git with distributed development on GitHub
- **Coding Style***: ✅ Follows PEP 8 standards with ruff linting enforcement
- **Static Analysis**: ✅ Pre-commit hooks with ruff, isort, and other code quality tools
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Minimal, justified dependencies (numpy, astropy, ndcube)
- **Binaries**: ✅ Only test data files in repository, no unnecessary binaries

### 5. Python 3 ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Full Python 3 compatibility with modern version requirements and no legacy Python 2 support.

- **Python 3 Compatibility***: ✅ Requires Python >=3.10, fully compatible with Python 3.10-3.13

### 6. License ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Proper licensing implementation with permissive open-source license.

- **License Exists***: ✅ LICENSE.rst file present in repository
- **License Type**: ✅ BSD 2-clause license, which is permissive and recommended for scientific software
- **OSI Approved**: ✅ BSD 2-clause is OSI-approved and suitable for open source scientific software

*(\* = "must")*

## Recommendations

### 🔴 "Musts"
*These must be addressed to meet minimum PyHC standards*

1. **Add Code of Conduct**: Create a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file compatible with the Contributor Covenant and reference it in README
   - Use the Contributor Covenant template (https://www.contributor-covenant.org)
   - Place in repository root directory

### 🟡 "Shoulds"  
*Important for package quality but not blocking compliance*

1. **Expand Test Coverage**: Add unit tests for modules currently lacking test coverage
   - Create test files for spectrogram_sequence.py, meta.py, and instr/spice.py modules
   - Aim for >80% code coverage across the package

2. **Create Dedicated CONTRIBUTING.md**: Extract contribution guidelines from README into dedicated file
   - Include development setup instructions, coding standards, and PR process

### 🟢 Suggested Improvements
*Enhancements that would strengthen the package*

1. **Add GitHub Templates**: Create issue and pull request templates to standardize community contributions
   - Add .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ directory with bug report and feature request templates
   - Add .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md

2. **Add Security Policy**: Create SECURITY.md file for vulnerability reporting procedures

3. **Update conda-forge Package**: Ensure conda-forge version (0.5.1) stays current with PyPI version (0.6.0)

## Conclusion

sunraster is a well-maintained, high-quality Python package that demonstrates strong compliance with PyHC standards. The package excels in technical implementation with excellent CI/CD practices, comprehensive documentation, proper packaging, and modern development standards. The main gaps are in community governance structures, specifically the missing code of conduct. With minor improvements in community documentation and expanded testing, sunraster would achieve full PyHC compliance and serve as an exemplary package in the heliophysics Python ecosystem.
