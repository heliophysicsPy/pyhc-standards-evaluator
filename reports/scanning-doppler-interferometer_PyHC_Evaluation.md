## Executive Summary

The Scanning Doppler Interferometer package demonstrates weak compliance with PyHC standards, receiving "Requires improvement" ratings in four of six categories. The package provides specialized functionality for processing scanning Doppler interferometer data but suffers from minimal documentation, inadequate testing, and lack of community infrastructure. While the package is properly licensed and Python 3 compatible, its archived status and lack of active development significantly limit its suitability for the PyHC ecosystem.

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Community ![Requires improvement](https://img.shields.io/badge/Requires%20improvement-red.svg)

The repository is archived (read-only since 2022) with no community infrastructure in place, making it unsuitable for collaborative development.

- **Open Development**\*: ‚úÖ Code is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/space-physics/scanning-doppler-interferometer
- **Duplication**: ‚úÖ Provides specialized functionality for scanning Doppler interferometer data processing
- **Collaboration**\*: ‚ùå Repository is archived, no CONTRIBUTING.md, no issue templates, no welcoming infrastructure
- **Code of Conduct**\*: ‚ùå No code of conduct file found in repository

### 2. Documentation ![Requires improvement](https://img.shields.io/badge/Requires%20improvement-red.svg)

Documentation is severely lacking with minimal README content and no proper docstrings throughout the codebase.

- **Docstrings**\*: ‚ùå Functions lack proper docstrings following standard conventions
- **Docstring Content**\*: ‚ùå Existing docstrings don't describe inputs, outputs, or provide examples
- **Docstring Standards**\*: ‚ùå No adherence to numpydoc or other standard conventions
- **High-Level Documentation**\*: ‚ùå No guides, tutorials, or developer documentation beyond basic README
- **Documentation Accessibility**\*: ‚ùå No online documentation site, minimal content in version control

### 3. Testing ![Requires improvement](https://img.shields.io/badge/Requires%20improvement-red.svg)

Testing infrastructure is critically inadequate with only a single basic test and no coverage measurement or automation.

- **Unit Tests**\*: ‚ùå Only one basic test exists for the entire codebase
- **Integration Tests**\*: ‚ùå No integration testing framework present
- **Test Coverage**: ‚ùå No coverage measurement configured or reported
- **Automated Testing**: ‚ùå No CI/CD pipeline or automated testing on commits
- **System/Acceptance Testing**: ‚ùå No higher-level testing implemented

### 4. Software Maturity ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

The package demonstrates good packaging practices and version control but lacks releases and is archived, limiting its maturity.

- **Packaging**\*: ‚úÖ Properly organized as installable Python package with setup.py/setup.cfg
- **Releases**: ‚ùå No releases published on PyPI or Conda
- **Semantic Versioning**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Uses version 0.7.0 indicating pre-release status
- **OS Support**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration suggests OS independence but not explicitly tested
- **Version Control**\*: ‚úÖ Uses git for version control
- **Coding Style**\*: ‚ö†Ô∏è Has flake8 configuration but style adherence not verified
- **Static Analysis**: ‚ö†Ô∏è mypy.ini present but usage not automated
- **Dependencies**: ‚úÖ Minimal dependencies (pandas, python-dateutil, optional scipy/matplotlib)
- **Binaries**: ‚úÖ No inappropriate binaries in repository

### 5. Python 3 ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

The package is fully compatible with Python 3 and specifies appropriate version requirements.

- **Python 3 Compatibility**\*: ‚úÖ Requires Python 3.6+ with no Python 2 support

### 6. License ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

The package includes a proper permissive license suitable for open source scientific software.

- **License Exists**\*: ‚úÖ LICENSE.txt file present in repository
- **License Type**: ‚úÖ Uses BSD 2-Clause license (permissive)
- **OSI Approved**: ‚úÖ BSD 2-Clause is an OSI-approved license

## Recommendations

### üî¥ "Musts"
*These must be addressed to meet minimum PyHC standards*

1. **Establish Active Development**: Unarchive the repository or create a new actively maintained fork to enable collaboration and contributions.

2. **Add Code of Conduct**: Create a code of conduct file compatible with the Contributor Covenant and make it publicly available.

3. **Implement Proper Documentation**: Add comprehensive docstrings to all functions, classes, and modules following numpydoc or similar standards, including purpose, inputs, outputs, and examples.

4. **Create High-Level Documentation**: Develop guides, tutorials, and developer documentation beyond the basic README.

5. **Establish Comprehensive Testing**: Implement unit tests covering all major functionality and integration tests for component interactions.

6. **Add Collaboration Infrastructure**: Create CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines and establish a welcoming environment for contributors.

### üü° "Shoulds"
*Important for package quality but not blocking compliance*

1. **Publish Releases**: Create stable releases and publish to PyPI and/or Conda for easier installation.

2. **Implement CI/CD**: Set up automated testing, linting, and coverage reporting using GitHub Actions or similar.

3. **Measure Test Coverage**: Implement coverage measurement and aim for comprehensive test coverage.

4. **Add Online Documentation**: Create a documentation website using Sphinx or similar tools.

### üü¢ Suggested Improvements
*Enhancements that would strengthen the package*

1. **Add Example Notebooks**: Provide Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various use cases.

2. **Enhance Error Handling**: Improve error messages and input validation throughout the codebase.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Consider optimizing data processing routines for larger datasets.

## Conclusion

The Scanning Doppler Interferometer package addresses a specialized scientific need but falls significantly short of PyHC standards in most areas. The archived status of the repository is the most critical barrier to compliance, as it prevents the collaborative development that PyHC promotes. While the package demonstrates good licensing and Python 3 compatibility, substantial work is needed in documentation, testing, and community infrastructure to meet PyHC standards. The package would benefit from active maintenance and modernization to align with contemporary scientific Python development practices.
