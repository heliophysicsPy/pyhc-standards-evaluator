*(\* = "must")*

## Recommendations

### ðŸŸ¡ "Shoulds"
*Important for package quality but not blocking compliance*

1. **Add conda-forge package**: Submit package to conda-forge for broader distribution and easier installation in conda environments
2. **Expand CI platform coverage**: Add Windows and macOS testing matrices to GitHub Actions workflow to ensure comprehensive cross-platform validation

### ðŸŸ¢ Suggested Improvements
*Enhancements that would strengthen the package*

1. **Add performance benchmarking**: Implement automated performance regression testing for computation-heavy operations
2. **Enhance documentation build verification**: Add documentation build testing to CI pipeline to catch documentation warnings
3. **Add security scanning**: Integrate security dependency scanning (e.g., safety, bandit) into CI workflow
