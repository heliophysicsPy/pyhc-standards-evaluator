## Executive Summary

FISSpy demonstrates moderate compliance with PyHC standards, particularly excelling in Python 3 compatibility and licensing. The package provides specialized functionality for GST/FISS solar instrument data analysis with good packaging and distribution practices. However, it requires significant improvement in testing infrastructure and community development standards. To achieve full PyHC compliance, the primary focus should be on implementing comprehensive testing and establishing proper community guidelines.

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Community ![Requires improvement](https://img.shields.io/badge/Requires%20improvement-red.svg)

The project lacks essential community infrastructure including code of conduct and contribution guidelines, preventing effective community engagement.

- **Open Development**\*: ✅ Code is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/SNU-sunday/fisspy
- **Duplication**: ✅ Provides unique functionality for GST/FISS solar instrument data analysis, not duplicating existing packages
- **Collaboration**\*: ❌ No CONTRIBUTING.md file, no issue templates, no clear contribution process outlined
- **Code of Conduct**\*: ❌ No CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file found in repository

### 2. Documentation ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

Documentation exists with good docstring practices but lacks comprehensive high-level guides and complete online accessibility.

- **Docstrings**\*: ✅ Functions and classes have docstrings (e.g., `lambdameter` function in doppler.py has detailed parameter descriptions)
- **Docstring Content**\*: ✅ Docstrings describe purpose, inputs, outputs, and include parameter details
- **Docstring Standards**\*: ⚠️ Follows basic documentation conventions but not consistently numpydoc format
- **High-Level Documentation**\*: ⚠️ HTML documentation exists in docs/ directory but lacks comprehensive tutorials and developer guides
- **Documentation Accessibility**\*: ⚠️ Documentation present in version control but online accessibility at http://fiss.snu.ac.kr/fisspy/ needs verification

### 3. Testing ![Requires improvement](https://img.shields.io/badge/Requires%20improvement-red.svg)

Testing infrastructure is critically lacking with no test suite, automated testing, or coverage measurement implemented.

- **Unit Tests**\*: ❌ No test files or test directories found in the repository
- **Integration Tests**\*: ❌ No integration testing framework present
- **Test Coverage**: ❌ No coverage measurement tools or configuration found
- **Automated Testing**: ❌ No CI/CD configuration files (.github/workflows, .travis.yml, etc.) found
- **System/Acceptance Testing**: ❌ No evidence of system-level testing implementation

### 4. Software Maturity ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

Strong packaging and release practices with proper versioning, but lacks automated code quality tools and has excessive dependencies.

- **Packaging**\*: ✅ Properly packaged with setup.py, installable via pip/conda
- **Releases**: ✅ Available on PyPI and conda-forge, version 1.2.0 indicates stable release (>=1.0)
- **Semantic Versioning**: ✅ Uses semantic versioning (1.2.0)
- **OS Support**: ✅ Python package should work across Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Version Control**\*: ✅ Uses git for version control with proper repository structure
- **Coding Style**\*: ⚠️ Code appears to follow basic Python conventions but no evidence of PEP 8 enforcement
- **Static Analysis**: ❌ No linting configuration files (pylint, flake8, etc.) found
- **Dependencies**: ❌ Excessive dependencies listed in setup.py (numba, scipy, astropy, sunpy, matplotlib, interpolation, statsmodels, beautifulsoup4, pandas, ffmpeg, pyqt, joblib)
- **Binaries**: ✅ Repository avoids binary files except for necessary data samples

### 5. Python 3 ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Excellent Python 3 compatibility with proper version requirements and no Python 2 legacy code.

- **Python 3 Compatibility**\*: ✅ Requires Python >=3.6, fully compatible with Python 3, no Python 2 support maintained

### 6. License ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Proper permissive licensing that meets PyHC requirements for open source scientific software.

- **License Exists**\*: ✅ LICENSE.txt file present in repository
- **License Type**: ✅ Uses BSD-2-Clause license, which is permissive and recommended for scientific software
- **OSI Approved**: ✅ BSD-2-Clause is an OSI-approved license

*(\* = "must")*

## Recommendations

### 🔴 "Musts"
*These must be addressed to meet minimum PyHC standards*

1. **Implement Testing Infrastructure**: Create comprehensive unit tests covering core functionality, set up test directory structure, and implement automated testing
   - Create tests/ directory with unit tests for each module
   - Add integration tests for key workflows
   - Implement test coverage measurement

2. **Add Code of Conduct**: Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file compatible with Contributor Covenant
   - Use standard Contributor Covenant template
   - Make it prominently accessible in repository

3. **Create Contribution Guidelines**: Add CONTRIBUTING.md with clear guidelines for contributing to the project
   - Include development setup instructions
   - Define code contribution process
   - Add issue and pull request templates

### 🟡 "Shoulds"
*Important for package quality but not blocking compliance*

1. **Implement Automated Testing**: Set up CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to run tests automatically
2. **Add Static Analysis Tools**: Configure pylint, flake8, or similar tools to enforce PEP 8 compliance
3. **Improve Documentation**: Enhance online documentation with comprehensive tutorials and developer guides
4. **Reduce Dependencies**: Review and minimize the extensive dependency list to only essential packages

### 🟢 Suggested Improvements
*Enhancements that would strengthen the package*

1. **Standardize Docstrings**: Consistently adopt numpydoc format across all modules
2. **Add Code Examples**: Include more comprehensive examples in documentation and docstrings
3. **Implement Semantic Release**: Consider automated semantic versioning and release processes

## Conclusion

FISSpy provides valuable specialized functionality for solar physics research with good packaging practices and proper licensing. The package demonstrates solid software engineering in some areas but requires significant improvement in testing and community infrastructure to meet PyHC standards. The lack of any testing framework is the most critical gap that needs immediate attention. With focused effort on implementing testing, community guidelines, and automated quality assurance, FISSpy can achieve full PyHC compliance while maintaining its scientific value to the solar physics community.
