## Executive Summary

GOESplot demonstrates moderate compliance with PyHC standards, excelling in software maturity, Python 3 compatibility, and licensing but requiring significant improvement in testing infrastructure. The package provides valuable functionality for downloading and plotting GOES satellite weather data with a clean, installable package structure. To achieve full PyHC compliance, the primary focus should be on expanding the testing framework and establishing community collaboration infrastructure.

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Community ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

The project demonstrates open development but lacks formal community engagement infrastructure, preventing full compliance with collaboration standards.

- **Open Development**\*: ‚úÖ Code is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/space-physics/GOESplot with public development history
- **Duplication**: ‚úÖ Provides unique GOES satellite data downloading and visualization functionality not duplicated elsewhere in the ecosystem
- **Collaboration**\*: ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic README exists with usage instructions but no CONTRIBUTING.md, issue templates, or formal contribution process
- **Code of Conduct**\*: ‚ùå No code of conduct file found in repository, required for PyHC compliance

### 2. Documentation ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

Documentation exists but lacks the comprehensive coverage and standard formatting required for full PyHC compliance.

- **Docstrings**\*: ‚ö†Ô∏è 67% of functions have docstrings (10/15), but no module-level docstrings exist
- **Docstring Content**\*: ‚ùå Docstrings are minimal single-line descriptions lacking parameter descriptions, return types, and examples
- **Docstring Standards**\*: ‚ùå Uses simple string format rather than standard conventions like numpydoc or Google style
- **High-Level Documentation**\*: ‚ö†Ô∏è Comprehensive README with installation and usage examples, but no API documentation or tutorials beyond basic usage
- **Documentation Accessibility**\*: ‚ö†Ô∏è Documentation exists in version control but no online documentation site (ReadtheDocs, GitHub Pages)

### 3. Testing ![Requires improvement](https://img.shields.io/badge/Requires%20improvement-red.svg)

Testing infrastructure is critically lacking with minimal unit tests and no coverage measurement, requiring immediate attention for PyHC compliance.

- **Unit Tests**\*: ‚ùå Only 2 basic unit tests exist (`test_load_preview`, `test_load_hires`) covering minimal functionality
- **Integration Tests**\*: ‚ùå No integration tests testing component interactions or end-to-end workflows
- **Test Coverage**: ‚ùå No coverage measurement configured, estimated coverage <15% based on function testing
- **Automated Testing**: ‚úÖ GitHub Actions CI configured with pytest execution on Python code changes
- **System/Acceptance Testing**: ‚ùå No higher-level testing beyond basic unit tests

### 4. Software Maturity ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

The package demonstrates excellent software maturity practices with proper packaging, releases, and development infrastructure.

- **Packaging**\*: ‚úÖ Well-organized installable Python package using modern setuptools with src/ layout
- **Releases**: ‚úÖ Version 1.1.0 available on PyPI with proper semantic versioning (>= 1.0 indicates stable)
- **Semantic Versioning**: ‚úÖ Follows semantic versioning with stable 1.x.x release numbering
- **OS Support**: ‚úÖ Platform-independent Python code supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Version Control**\*: ‚úÖ Uses Git with comprehensive commit history and GitHub hosting
- **Coding Style**\*: ‚úÖ Configured for PEP 8 compliance with Black formatter (line-length = 100)
- **Static Analysis**: ‚úÖ Uses flake8 and mypy for linting and type checking in CI pipeline
- **Dependencies**: ‚úÖ Minimal, well-justified dependencies (numpy, xarray, requests, dateutil, imageio)
- **Binaries**: ‚úÖ No unnecessary binary files in repository; test data appropriately included

### 5. Python 3 ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Full Python 3 compatibility with modern language features and no legacy Python 2 support.

- **Python 3 Compatibility**\*: ‚úÖ Requires Python >= 3.7, uses modern type annotations and f-strings, no Python 2 support

### 6. License ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Proper permissive licensing fully compliant with PyHC requirements for open source scientific software.

- **License Exists**\*: ‚úÖ Complete Apache License 2.0 text present in LICENSE.txt
- **License Type**: ‚úÖ Apache 2.0 is a permissive OSI-approved license suitable for scientific software
- **OSI Approved**: ‚úÖ Apache License 2.0 is OSI-approved and widely accepted

*(\* = "must")*

## Recommendations

### üî¥ "Musts"
*These must be addressed to meet minimum PyHC standards*

1. **Add Code of Conduct**: Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md compatible with Contributor Covenant and make it publicly available
2. **Implement Comprehensive Testing**: Expand test suite to cover all major functions and modules with unit and integration tests
3. **Add Contribution Guidelines**: Create CONTRIBUTING.md with clear guidelines for community contributions
4. **Enhance Docstrings**: Convert all docstrings to standard format (numpydoc/Google) with parameter descriptions, return types, and examples
5. **Add Module Docstrings**: Include docstrings for all modules (io.py, plots.py, __init__.py) describing their purpose

### üü° "Shoulds"
*Important for package quality but not blocking compliance*

1. **Implement Test Coverage Measurement**: Add coverage reporting to CI pipeline and aim for >80% coverage
2. **Create Online Documentation**: Set up ReadtheDocs or GitHub Pages for comprehensive API documentation
3. **Add Integration Tests**: Create tests that verify end-to-end workflows and component interactions

### üü¢ Suggested Improvements
*Enhancements that would strengthen the package*

1. **Add Issue/PR Templates**: Create GitHub issue and pull request templates to facilitate community engagement
2. **Expand Examples**: Add more comprehensive examples and tutorials beyond basic README usage
3. **Performance Testing**: Add benchmarks for data download and processing performance

## Conclusion

GOESplot is a technically sound package that provides valuable GOES satellite data functionality with excellent software engineering practices in packaging and Python 3 compatibility. However, it requires significant improvements in testing infrastructure and community engagement to meet full PyHC standards. The package's strong foundation in software maturity makes it well-positioned for these enhancements. Addressing the required "musts" - particularly adding a code of conduct, comprehensive testing, and contribution guidelines - would elevate this package to full PyHC compliance while maintaining its current high quality in core functionality.
