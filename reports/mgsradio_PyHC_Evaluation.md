- **Documentation Accessibility**\*: ‚úÖ Documentation is in version control and available online via GitHub

### 3. Testing ![Requires improvement](https://img.shields.io/badge/Requires%20improvement-red.svg)

Testing infrastructure is critically lacking with minimal unit tests, no automation, and no coverage measurement, requiring immediate attention for PyHC compliance.

- **Unit Tests**\*: ‚ùå Only one test file with a single test function covering minimal functionality
- **Integration Tests**\*: ‚ùå No comprehensive integration testing framework
- **Test Coverage**: ‚ùå No coverage measurement implemented, estimated <5% coverage
- **Automated Testing**: ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline configured with GitHub Actions running pytest, flake8, and mypy
- **System/Acceptance Testing**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual validation via example script exists but isn't automated

### 4. Software Maturity ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

The package demonstrates good software engineering practices with proper packaging and version control, but lacks distribution through standard Python package repositories.

- **Packaging**\*: ‚úÖ Well-organized as installable Python package with proper setup.py/setup.cfg
- **Releases**: ‚ùå No stable releases found on PyPI. ‚ö†Ô∏è No releases found on Conda
- **Semantic Versioning**: ‚úÖ Uses semantic versioning (1.1.0)
- **OS Support**: ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatible (no OS-specific dependencies identified)
- **Version Control**\*: ‚úÖ Uses git with distributed version control on GitHub
- **Coding Style**\*: ‚úÖ Includes flake8 configuration and follows basic PEP 8 guidelines
- **Static Analysis**: ‚úÖ Uses flake8 and mypy for static analysis in CI pipeline
- **Dependencies**: ‚úÖ Minimal and appropriate dependencies (numpy, pandas, xarray, python-dateutil)
- **Binaries**: ‚úÖ Binary files appropriately limited to test data and example images

### 5. Python 3 ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

The package fully supports Python 3 with modern requirements and no legacy Python 2 support.

- **Python 3 Compatibility**\*: ‚úÖ Package requires Python >= 3.6, fully compatible with Python 3

### 6. License ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

The package has an appropriate permissive license fully compliant with open source scientific software requirements.

- **License Exists**\*: ‚úÖ LICENSE.txt file is present in repository root
- **License Type**: ‚úÖ Apache License 2.0 is permissive and appropriate for scientific software
- **OSI Approved**: ‚úÖ Apache 2.0 is an OSI-approved license

## Recommendations

### üî¥ "Musts"
*These must be addressed to meet minimum PyHC standards*

1. **Add Code of Conduct**: Implement a Contributor Covenant-compatible code of conduct in the repository root
   - Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file with standard community guidelines

2. **Implement Comprehensive Docstrings**: Add docstrings to all functions, classes, and modules
   - Document loop_mgs(), plot_occultation(), read_mgs_occultation(), and get_occult_time()
   - Include purpose, parameters, return values, and usage examples
   - Follow numpydoc or similar standard conventions

3. **Expand Unit Testing**: Create comprehensive unit tests covering all modules and functions
   - Add tests for individual functions in base.py, plots.py, and read.py
   - Test error handling and edge cases
   - Achieve reasonable test coverage (>80%)

4. **Add Contribution Guidelines**: Create CONTRIBUTING.md with clear contribution process
   - Include guidelines for submitting issues and pull requests
   - Document development setup and testing procedures

### üü° "Shoulds"
*Important for package quality but not blocking compliance*

1. **Publish to PyPI**: Make package available through pip installation
   - Set up automated publishing workflow
   - Ensure consistent versioning and release management

2. **Add High-Level Documentation**: Create comprehensive user guides and tutorials
   - Document data format requirements and usage examples
   - Add developer documentation for contributors

3. **Implement Test Coverage Measurement**: Add coverage reporting to CI pipeline
   - Integrate coverage tools to track testing completeness
   - Set minimum coverage thresholds

### üü¢ Suggested Improvements
*Enhancements that would strengthen the package*

1. **Fix Import Inconsistency**: Resolve mgsutils vs mgsradio naming in PlotMGSoccult.py
   - Update example script to use correct package name

2. **Add Type Hints**: Implement comprehensive type annotations throughout codebase
   - Enhance existing mypy configuration with stricter rules

3. **Document Configuration Constants**: Add explanations for hard-coded values like sampling rates
   - Make key parameters configurable rather than hard-coded

## Conclusion

mgsradio serves as a specialized tool for Mars Global Surveyor radio occultation data analysis, providing valuable functionality for atmospheric science research. While the package demonstrates solid software engineering fundamentals with proper licensing, version control, and Python 3 compatibility, it requires significant improvements in documentation and testing to meet PyHC standards. The core functionality appears robust and the package structure is well-organized, indicating that with focused effort on the identified deficiencies, this package could achieve full PyHC compliance and serve as a reliable resource for the heliophysics community.
