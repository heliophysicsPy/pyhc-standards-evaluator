## Executive Summary

WMM2020 demonstrates moderate compliance with PyHC standards. The package excels in software maturity with strong CI/CD practices and comprehensive linting, plus maintains full Python 3 compatibility and appropriate licensing. However, it requires improvement in community infrastructure (missing code of conduct), documentation comprehensiveness, and testing coverage. The package provides valuable scientific functionality for geomagnetic modeling but needs enhanced community support structures to achieve full PyHC compliance.

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Community ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

While the project demonstrates open development and provides unique geomagnetic modeling functionality, the absence of a code of conduct and limited contribution infrastructure prevents a "Good" rating.

- **Open Development**\*: ‚úÖ Code is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/space-physics/wmm2020 with full development history visible
- **Duplication**: ‚úÖ Provides unique WMM2020 geomagnetic model implementation with Python interface, distinct from other geomagnetic packages
- **Collaboration**\*: ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic README exists but no CONTRIBUTING.md or issue templates to guide contributions
- **Code of Conduct**\*: ‚ùå No CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file found in repository

### 2. Documentation ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

Documentation exists with basic usage examples and API documentation, but lacks comprehensive guides and tutorials expected for scientific software.

- **Docstrings**\*: ‚úÖ All functions have docstrings (wmm, transect, wmm_point functions in base.py:24-242)
- **Docstring Content**\*: ‚ö†Ô∏è Docstrings describe purpose and inputs but lack comprehensive examples and output descriptions
- **Docstring Standards**\*: ‚ö†Ô∏è Docstrings present but don't follow standard conventions like numpydoc format
- **High-Level Documentation**\*: ‚ùå Only README.md present, no comprehensive guides, tutorials, or developer documentation
- **Documentation Accessibility**\*: ‚ö†Ô∏è Documentation in version control but no online documentation site beyond README

### 3. Testing ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

Basic testing framework is present with pytest and automated CI, but test coverage appears limited to core functionality verification.

- **Unit Tests**\*: ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic unit tests present in src/wmm2020/tests/test_all.py:1-32 but only cover main functions
- **Integration Tests**\*: ‚ö†Ô∏è Tests verify function interactions but limited scope compared to codebase size
- **Test Coverage**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Coverage configuration present (.coveragerc) but no visible coverage reporting or metrics
- **Automated Testing**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions testing on Linux, macOS, Windows
- **System/Acceptance Testing**: ‚ùå No evidence of higher-level testing beyond functional verification

### 4. Software Maturity ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Demonstrates excellent software engineering practices with proper packaging, versioning, multi-platform support, and comprehensive development tooling.

- **Packaging**\*: ‚úÖ Well-organized Python package with proper setup.py, pyproject.toml, and src-layout structure
- **Releases**: ‚úÖ Stable releases available on PyPI (version 1.1.1), proper semantic versioning for stable software
- **Semantic Versioning**: ‚úÖ Follows semantic versioning (1.1.1 indicates stable release)
- **OS Support**: ‚úÖ CI testing confirms support for Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms
- **Version Control**\*: ‚úÖ Uses Git with comprehensive commit history on GitHub
- **Coding Style**\*: ‚úÖ Follows PEP 8 with Black formatting (line-length 100) and flake8 linting
- **Static Analysis**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive tooling: flake8, mypy, black with proper configuration files
- **Dependencies**: ‚úÖ Minimal dependencies (xarray, numpy) appropriate for scientific computing scope
- **Binaries**: ‚úÖ Repository avoids unnecessary binaries, uses build-on-run approach for C extensions

### 5. Python 3 ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Package fully supports Python 3 with modern Python practices and has dropped Python 2 support.

- **Python 3 Compatibility**\*: ‚úÖ Requires Python ‚â•3.7 (setup.cfg:22), uses modern Python features like type hints

### 6. License ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Package uses appropriate public domain licensing for the underlying WMM model, which is permissive and suitable for scientific software.

- **License Exists**\*: ‚úÖ LICENSE.txt file present in repository root
- **License Type**: ‚úÖ Public domain license (WMM model is US government work, not subject to copyright)
- **OSI Approved**: ‚úÖ Public domain is effectively more permissive than OSI-approved licenses

## Recommendations

### üî¥ "Musts"
*These must be addressed to meet minimum PyHC standards*

1. **Add Code of Conduct**: Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file using Contributor Covenant template
2. **Enhance Collaboration Infrastructure**: Create CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines and development setup instructions
3. **Expand Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation including tutorials, API reference, and developer guides
4. **Improve Test Coverage**: Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests covering edge cases and error conditions

### üü° "Shoulds"
*Important for package quality but not blocking compliance*

1. **Add Issue/PR Templates**: Create GitHub issue and pull request templates to standardize contributions
2. **Implement Coverage Reporting**: Add coverage badges and reporting to CI pipeline
3. **Expand Docstring Standards**: Convert docstrings to numpydoc format with comprehensive examples

### üü¢ Suggested Improvements
*Enhancements that would strengthen the package*

1. **Create Online Documentation**: Set up documentation hosting (ReadTheDocs, GitHub Pages)
2. **Add System Testing**: Implement validation against official WMM test cases
3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Add performance tests for large grid calculations

## Conclusion

WMM2020 is a well-engineered scientific package that provides valuable geomagnetic modeling capabilities with excellent software engineering practices. The package demonstrates strong technical maturity through comprehensive CI/CD, proper packaging, and multi-platform support. However, to achieve full PyHC compliance, the project needs to focus on community infrastructure development, particularly adding a code of conduct and contribution guidelines, along with expanding documentation and testing coverage. The package's solid technical foundation makes these improvements straightforward to implement.
