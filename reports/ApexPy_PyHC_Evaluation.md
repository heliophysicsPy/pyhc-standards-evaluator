## Recommendations

### ðŸŸ¡ "Shoulds"
*Important for package quality but not blocking compliance*

1. **Consider Conda Distribution**: While PyPI distribution is excellent, adding conda-forge distribution would improve accessibility for scientific Python users who prefer conda environments.

### ðŸŸ¢ Suggested Improvements
*Enhancements that would strengthen the package*

1. **Add Integration Examples**: Consider adding Jupyter notebook examples showing integration with other geospace physics packages to demonstrate broader ecosystem usage.

2. **Performance Benchmarking**: Document performance characteristics and benchmarks for different coordinate conversion operations to help users optimize their workflows.

## Conclusion

ApexPy is an exemplary PyHC package that fully meets all community standards. The package demonstrates professional software development practices, comprehensive testing, excellent documentation, and serves an important scientific need in the geomagnetic coordinates community. No critical improvements are required for PyHC compliance, making it a model package for the PyHC ecosystem.
