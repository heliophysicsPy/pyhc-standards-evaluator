## Executive Summary

IGRF demonstrates moderate compliance with PyHC standards, excelling in software maturity and licensing while requiring improvement in community infrastructure and documentation completeness. The package provides valuable geomagnetic field calculations for the scientific community with a clean, well-packaged Python interface. To achieve full PyHC compliance, the primary focus should be on adding contribution guidelines, a code of conduct, and comprehensive docstring documentation.

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Community ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

The project demonstrates open development with automated testing but lacks formal community infrastructure including contribution guidelines and code of conduct.

- **Open Development**\*: ✅ Code is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/space-physics/igrf with open development practices
- **Duplication**: ✅ Provides unique IGRF geomagnetic field modeling functionality not duplicated elsewhere in Python ecosystem
- **Collaboration**\*: ❌ No CONTRIBUTING.md file, no issue templates, and no clear contribution guidelines found
- **Code of Conduct**\*: ❌ No CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md or equivalent file found in repository

### 2. Documentation ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

Documentation includes a comprehensive README with examples and installation instructions, but function-level documentation is incomplete.

- **Docstrings**\*: ⚠️ Some functions have docstrings (e.g., igrf() function) but many functions lack documentation
- **Docstring Content**\*: ⚠️ Existing docstrings describe purpose and parameters but lack comprehensive examples and return value descriptions
- **Docstring Standards**\*: ❌ Docstrings do not consistently follow standard conventions (numpydoc/numpy style)
- **High-Level Documentation**\*: ⚠️ Good README with examples and usage instructions, but lacks comprehensive tutorials or developer documentation
- **Documentation Accessibility**\*: ✅ Documentation is in version control and accessible through GitHub README

### 3. Testing ![Partially met](https://img.shields.io/badge/Partially%20met-orange.svg)

The package includes basic unit tests with automated CI testing, but coverage appears limited and lacks comprehensive integration testing.

- **Unit Tests**\*: ⚠️ Unit tests exist in test_mod.py but only cover basic functionality, many modules lack tests
- **Integration Tests**\*: ❌ No comprehensive integration testing framework beyond basic function validation
- **Test Coverage**: ❌ No coverage measurement tools configured, estimated coverage appears low
- **Automated Testing**: ✅ GitHub Actions CI configured with pytest running on Ubuntu and macOS
- **System/Acceptance Testing**: ❌ No system-level or acceptance testing beyond basic unit tests

### 4. Software Maturity ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

The package demonstrates excellent software maturity with proper packaging, version control, releases, and cross-platform support.

- **Packaging**\*: ✅ Well-organized as installable Python package with pyproject.toml configuration
- **Releases**: ✅ Available on PyPI (version 13.0.2), supports pip installation
- **Semantic Versioning**: ✅ Follows semantic versioning (13.0.2 indicating major.minor.patch)
- **OS Support**: ✅ Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows with appropriate build configurations
- **Version Control**\*: ✅ Uses Git with GitHub hosting and proper version control practices
- **Coding Style**\*: ✅ Includes linting tools (flake8) and mypy type checking in CI pipeline
- **Static Analysis**: ✅ Uses flake8, mypy, and other linting tools configured in pyproject.toml
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Minimal dependencies (xarray, numpy) with clear requirements
- **Binaries**: ✅ No unnecessary binary files in repository, only required coefficient files

### 5. Python 3 ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

The package is fully compatible with modern Python 3 versions and has dropped Python 2 support.

- **Python 3 Compatibility**\*: ✅ Requires Python >=3.9, fully compatible with Python 3, no Python 2 support

### 6. License ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

The package uses an appropriate open source license for scientific software.

- **License Exists**\*: ✅ MIT license file present in repository (LICENSE.txt)
- **License Type**: ✅ MIT is a permissive license (not copyleft like GPL)
- **OSI Approved**: ✅ MIT is an OSI-approved permissive license

*(\* = "must")*

## Recommendations

### 🔴 "Musts"
*These must be addressed to meet minimum PyHC standards*

1. **Add Contribution Guidelines**: Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file with clear guidelines for code contributions, issue reporting, and development setup
2. **Implement Code of Conduct**: Add a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file compatible with the Contributor Covenant
3. **Complete Function Documentation**: Add comprehensive docstrings to all functions, classes, and modules following numpydoc standards
4. **Improve Docstring Content**: Ensure all docstrings describe purpose, inputs, outputs, and include usage examples

### 🟡 "Shoulds"
*Important for package quality but not blocking compliance*

1. **Expand Test Coverage**: Add unit tests for uncovered modules and implement test coverage measurement
2. **Add Integration Tests**: Create comprehensive tests that verify component interactions
3. **Enhance High-Level Documentation**: Add tutorials, developer guides, and more comprehensive documentation beyond README

### 🟢 Suggested Improvements
*Enhancements that would strengthen the package*

1. **Add Coverage Reporting**: Implement coverage measurement and reporting in CI pipeline
2. **Expand CI Testing**: Add Windows testing to CI matrix for complete cross-platform validation
3. **Add Issue Templates**: Create GitHub issue templates to guide bug reports and feature requests

## Conclusion

IGRF is a scientifically valuable package that provides essential geomagnetic field modeling capabilities with good software engineering practices. The package demonstrates strong software maturity and proper licensing, making it suitable for scientific use. However, to meet full PyHC compliance, the project needs to address missing community infrastructure (contribution guidelines and code of conduct) and improve documentation completeness. With these improvements, IGRF would be an excellent addition to the PyHC ecosystem.
