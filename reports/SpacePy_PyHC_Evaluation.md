### 4. Software Maturity ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Strong software maturity practices with modern packaging and professional development workflows, but missing conda-forge distribution.

- **Packaging**\*: ‚úÖ Well-organized package structure with both setup.py and modern pyproject.toml configuration
- **Releases**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Stable releases available on PyPI (latest: 0.7.0) with proper versioning, but not available through conda-forge
- **Semantic Versioning**: ‚úÖ Follows semantic versioning (current development: 0.8.0a0, latest stable: 0.7.0)
- **OS Support**: ‚úÖ Cross-platform support for Windows, macOS, and Linux with platform-specific binary wheels
- **Version Control**\*: ‚úÖ Uses Git with comprehensive commit history and professional branching strategies
- **Coding Style**\*: ‚úÖ Follows PEP 8 standards with consistent coding style across the codebase
- **Static Analysis**: ‚úÖ Uses static analysis tools and maintains code quality standards
- **Dependencies**: ‚úÖ Minimal, well-justified dependencies (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, h5py, python-dateutil)
- **Binaries**: ‚úÖ Binary files appropriately managed with data files in `spacepy/data/` and compiled extensions handled properly

### 5. Python 3 ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

Full Python 3 compatibility with proper deprecation of Python 2 support.

- **Python 3 Compatibility**\*: ‚úÖ Full compatibility with Python 3.7+ as specified in pyproject.toml with active testing across Python 3.7-3.13

### 6. License ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/Good-brightgreen.svg)

SpacePy uses a permissive custom license that meets open source scientific software requirements.

- **License Exists**\*: ‚úÖ LICENSE.md file present with clear licensing terms
- **License Type**: ‚úÖ Custom permissive license (Triad National Security, LLC) similar to Python Software Foundation License, allowing redistribution and modification
- **OSI Approved**: ‚ö†Ô∏è While not formally OSI-approved, the license follows OSI principles and is compatible with open source scientific software requirements

*(\* = "must")*

## Recommendations

### üü° "Shoulds"
*Important for package quality but not blocking compliance*

1. **Conda-forge Distribution**: Submit SpacePy to conda-forge to provide conda installation option alongside PyPI
   - Create conda-forge recipe following community guidelines
   - This would elevate the Software Maturity rating to "Good"

### üü¢ Suggested Improvements
*Enhancements that would strengthen the package*

1. **Coverage Reporting**: Add test coverage reporting to CI/CD pipeline and publish coverage metrics
2. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Consider adding pre-commit hooks for automated code quality checks
3. **Release Automation**: Consider automating release process with GitHub Actions for more frequent releases

## Conclusion

SpacePy exemplifies excellent PyHC standards compliance and serves as a model for the space physics community. The package demonstrates mature software engineering practices, comprehensive documentation, robust testing, and strong community governance. With excellent scientific value and broad adoption in the heliophysics community, SpacePy represents a cornerstone package that fulfills PyHC's mission of promoting accurate and open research standards. The only minor gap is the absence of conda-forge distribution, which would provide users with an additional installation pathway. Overall, SpacePy demonstrates exemplary adherence to PyHC standards and continues to be a vital resource for space science research.
